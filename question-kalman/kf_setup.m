%% INTRODUCTION
% This setup file must be executed BEFORE running the kalman tests.
% 
% Consider the linear system:
%
%       x = Ax + w
%       z = Hx + v
%
% where 
%
%       x = state (dimension n),
%       z = observation (dimension m),
%	A, H are given matrices,
% 	w and v are Gaussian noise with mean zero with
%		covariance matrices
%		Q = cov(w) and R = cov(v).
%
% 	In the discrete setting, the states should be subscripted
% 	x_1, x_2, etc.   But we omit it here for simplicity.
%
% For our physical example, imagine a particle moving along
% the real line (x-axis).  At time t, it is at distance s(t)
%	from the origin, and its velocity is v(t).
% Thus, our state
%
% 	x = [s; v]
%
% where s and v are are above.
%
% We model the situation where the velocity is decaying at
% a constant rate delta (0<delta<1). So the update equation for v is
%	
%	v = v.delta
%
% Also the update equation for s is
%
%	s = s + v.rho
%  
% For some rho (0<rho).  Think of rho as the discrete sampling rate.
% Therefore the matrix 2x2 matrix A in Matlab notation is simply
%
%	A =    [ [1 rho]; [0 delta]]
%
% As for observation z, we assume we are directly observing x.
% Thus
%	z = H.x + v 
% where
% 	H is identity matrix (H = eye(2) in Matlab).
%
% All these variables (and more) is collected in a
% Matlab "structure" which we call ppp (for "parameters").
% 
% How to treat noise:
%	Assume that the covariance matrices Q (nxn), R (mxm)
% 	are proportional to identity matrices:
%		Q = eye(n)*q
%		R = eye(n)*r
%	where q and r are some positive values
%	But q and r are unknown!
%	So we estimate by some value qh (qhat) and rh (rhat).
%	The initial state covariance matrix P (nxn) is also
%	of this form:
%		P = eye(n)*p.
%
%	The only actual noise we need to actually generate are to
%	perturb the observations.   
%	To ensure repeatability of our experiments, we need to
%		(1) fix a seed for the random number generator
%		(2) store the sequences of process noise (PN)
%			and observation noise (ON).
%			They are generated using the parameters q,r.
%	We store the sequence of actual (noisy) states in an array XX:
%			x(k+1) = A*x(k) + PN(k)
%	Then the sequence of observations is simply 
%			ZZ = XX + ON
%	The Kalman filter will produce two sequences:
%		XH = estimated states (x-hat)
%		PH = covariance of x-hat's
%			These are generated using estimates for
%			q and r (called qh and rh)
%
% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% But since we want to run our experiments with different choices
% of the parameters, we need to make ppp into an array.
% We will specify ppp(1) for you.  For your experiments, you
% can define ppp(2), ppp(3), etc.


%% Default set of parameters, ppp(1):
% Please DO NOT modify any of the following initialization.

clear

i=1;	% i refers to the first set of parameters
n=2;	% state dimension
m=2;	% observation dimension

ppp(i).seed = 111;     % random seed to ensure repeatable tests
ppp(i).N = 15;         % number of steps
% Physical Problem
ppp(i).n = n;          % number of variables in state x
ppp(i).A = eye(n);     % matrix A (temporarily the identity)
ppp(i).m = m;          % number of variables in observation z
ppp(i).H = eye(m,n);	% observation matrix H (temporarily identity)
ppp(i).delta = 0.5;  	% decay rate
ppp(i).rho = 0.2;  	% sampling rate 
ppp(i).s0 = 0; 		% initial distance
ppp(i).v0 = 10;  	% initial speed
% Noise parameters:
ppp(i).ph = 0.2;	% initial uncertainty (p-hat)
ppp(i).q = 0.2;		% process noise
ppp(i).r = 0.3;		% observation noise
ppp(i).qh = 0.2;	% estimated process noise (q-hat)
ppp(i).rh = 0.3;	% estimated observation noise (r-hat)
% Time Sequences: XI, XX, ZZ, PN, ON, XH, PH
%	such that for i=1,...,N,
%		XI(i,:) = the ideal noise-free state,
%		XX(i,:) = x-hat, the actual (unknown) state, "XI+PN"
%		ZZ(i,:) = x-hat, the observed state,  "XX+ON"
%		PN(i,:) = v, the process noise in XX
%		ON(i,:) = w, the observation noise in ZZ
%		XH(i,:) = x-hat, the KF estimated state
%		PH{i}   = P, the covariance of x-hat
%
ppp(i).XI = zeros(2, ppp(i).N);	% XI(:,k) is the ideal noise-free state at time k
ppp(i).XX = zeros(2, ppp(i).N);	% XX(:,k) is the actual state at time k
ppp(i).ZZ = zeros(2, ppp(i).N);	% ZZ(:,k) is the observation at time k

ppp(i).PN = zeros(2, ppp(i).N);	% PN(:,k) is the process noise at time k
ppp(i).ON = zeros(2, ppp(i).N);	% ON(:,k) is the observation noise at time k

ppp(i).XH = zeros(2, ppp(i).N);	% XX(:,k) is the estimated state at time k
ppp(i).PH = cell(1, ppp(i).N);	% PH{k} is estimated covariance matrix P at time k
				% NOTE: unlike the other arrays, PH is a cell array.

% The first entry in XH and PH is somewhat arbitrary, and
% 	randomly determined by ppp(i).ph:
% 	Please do not accidentally delete this first entry.
ppp(i).XH(:,1) = [ppp(i).s0; ppp(i).v0] + ppp(i).ph *randn(2,1);
ppp(i).PH{1}   = ppp(i).ph *randn(2,1);

%% SOME initializiation

% Setup the matrix A, H, P, Q, R
ppp(i).A = [[1  ppp(i).rho]; [0 ppp(i).delta]];
ppp(i).H = eye(m,n);	 
ppp(i).P = ppp(i).ph * eye(ppp(i).n);
ppp(i).Q = ppp(i).qh * eye(ppp(i).n);
ppp(i).R = ppp(i).rh * eye(ppp(i).m);

% Initialize the random parameters:
rng(ppp(i).seed);				% random number generator
ppp(i).PN = ppp(i).q * randn(size(ppp(i).PN));	% process noise array 
ppp(i).ON = ppp(i).r * randn(size(ppp(i).ON));	% observation noise array

ppp(i).PH{1} = ppp(i).P;			% covariance P at time t=1

% NOTE: Q,R are estimates based on qh, rh;
% 	but the noise PN,ON are based on q, r.

%% Additional set of parameters
%  BELOW, you can add your own set of parameters
%	for ppp(2), ppp(3), etc.

% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

n=2;	% state dimension
m=4;	% observation dimension (we can repeat an observations, etc)

ppp(i).seed = 111;     % random seed to ensure repeatable tests
ppp(i).N = 40;         % number of steps (perhaps we now need more steps...)
% Physical Problem
ppp(i).n = n;          % number of variables in state x
ppp(i).A = eye(n);     % matrix A (temporarily the identity)
ppp(i).m = m;          % number of variables in observation z
